        <h3>
            I'm a Public Health Worker turned Software Engineer. To this day, I haven't lost my passion of
            healthcare
            and health improvement strategies, but have extended my technical reach. I am self-taught in programming
            and enjoy working across the entire full-stack lifecycle. During this time, as an
            early-careerist in Software Engineering, I am working on improving my skillset everyday and have skills in Cloud
            Technologies, UI Dev, and Data Science. If you're interested in learning more, don't hesitate to reach
